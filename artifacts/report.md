It would be nice if we could do something else while we are waiting for those long-running processes to complete. Modern computers offer two techniques for working on more than one operation at a time: parallelism and concurrency. Once we start writing programs that involve parallel or concurrent operations, though, we quickly encounter new challenges inherent to asynchronous programming , where operations may not finish sequentially in the order they were started. This chapter builds on Chapter 16’s use of threads for parallelism and concurrency by introducing an alternative approach to asynchronous programming: Rust’s Futures, Streams, the async and await syntax that supports them, and the tools for managing and coordinating between asynchronous operations. Let’s consider an example. Say you’re exporting a video you’ve created of a family celebration, an operation that could take anywhere from minutes to hours. The video export will use as much CPU and GPU power as it can. If you had only one CPU core and your operating system didn’t pause that export until it completed—that is, if it executed the export synchronously —you couldn’t do anything else on your computer while that task was running. That would be a pretty frustrating experience. Fortunately, your computer’s operating system can, and does, invisibly interrupt the export often enough to let you get other work done simultaneously. Now say you’re downloading a video shared by someone else, which can also take a while but does not take up as much CPU time. In this case, the CPU has to wait for data to arrive from the network. While you can start reading the data once it starts to arrive, it might take some time for all of it to show up. Even once the data is all present, if the video is quite large, it could take at least a second or two to load it all. That might not sound like much, but it’s a very long time for a modern processor, which can perform billions of operations every second. Again, your operating system will invisibly interrupt your program to allow the CPU to perform other work while waiting for the network call to finish. The video export is an example of a CPU-bound or compute-bound operation. It’s limited by the computer’s potential data processing speed within the CPU or GPU, and how much of that speed it can dedicate to the operation. The video download is an example of an IO-bound operation, because it’s limited by the speed of the computer’s input and output ; it can only go as fast as the data can be sent across the network. In both of these examples, the operating system’s invisible interrupts provide a form of concurrency. That concurrency happens only at the level of the entire program, though: the operating system interrupts one program to let other programs get work done. In many cases, because we understand our programs at a much more granular level than the operating system does, we can spot opportunities for concurrency that the operating system can’t see. For example, if we’re building a tool to manage file downloads, we should be able to write our program so that starting one download won’t lock up the UI, and users should be able to start multiple downloads at the same time. Many operating system APIs for interacting with the network are blocking , though; that is, they block the program’s progress until the data they’re processing is completely ready. Note: This is how most function calls work, if you think about it. However, the term blocking is usually reserved for function calls that interact with files, the network, or other resources on the computer, because those are the cases where an individual program would benefit from the operation being non -blocking. We could avoid blocking our main thread by spawning a dedicated thread to download each file. However, the overhead of those threads would eventually become a problem. It would be preferable if the call didn’t block in the first place. It would also be better if we could write in the same direct style we use in blocking code, similar to this: let data = fetch_data_from(url).await; println!("{data}"); That is exactly what Rust’s async (short for asynchronous ) abstraction gives us. In this chapter, you’ll learn all about async as we cover the following topics: How to use Rust’s async and await syntax How to use the async model to solve some of the same challenges we looked at in Chapter 16 How multithreading and async provide complementary solutions, that you can combine in many cases Before we see how async works in practice, though, we need to take a short detour to discuss the differences between parallelism and concurrency. Parallelism and Concurrency We’ve treated parallelism and concurrency as mostly interchangeable so far. Now we need to distinguish between them more precisely, because the differences will show up as we start working. Consider the different ways a team could split up work on a software project. You could assign a single member multiple tasks, assign each member one task, or use a mix of the two approaches. When an individual works on several different tasks before any of them is complete, this is concurrency . Maybe you have two different projects checked out on your computer, and when you get bored or stuck on one project, you switch to the other. You’re just one person, so you can’t make progress on both tasks at the exact same time, but you can multi-task, making progress on one at a time by switching between them (see Figure 17-1). Figure 17-1: A concurrent workflow, switching between Task A and Task B When the team splits up a group of tasks by having each member take one task and work on it alone, this is parallelism . Each person on the team can make progress at the exact same time (see Figure 17-2). Figure 17-2: A parallel workflow, where work happens on Task A and Task B independently In both of these workflows, you might have to coordinate between different tasks. Maybe you thought the task assigned to one person was totally independent from everyone else’s work, but it actually requires another person on the team to finish their task first. Some of the work could be done in parallel, but some of it was actually serial : it could only happen in a series, one task after the other, as in Figure 17-3. Figure 17-3: A partially parallel workflow, where work happens on Task A and Task B independently until Task A3 is blocked on the results of Task B3. Likewise, you might realize that one of your own tasks depends on another of your tasks. Now your concurrent work has also become serial. Parallelism and concurrency can intersect with each other, too. If you learn that a colleague is stuck until you finish one of your tasks, you’ll probably focus all your efforts on that task to “unblock” your colleague. You and your coworker are no longer able to work in parallel, and you’re also no longer able to work concurrently on your own tasks. The same basic dynamics come into play with software and hardware. On a machine with a single CPU core, the CPU can perform only one operation at a time, but it can still work concurrently. Using tools such as threads, processes, and async, the computer can pause one activity and switch to others before eventually cycling back to that first activity again. On a machine with multiple CPU cores, it can also do work in parallel. One core can be performing one task while another core performs a completely unrelated one, and those operations actually happen at the same time. When working with async in Rust, we’re always dealing with concurrency. Depending on the hardware, the operating system, and the async runtime we are using (more on async runtimes shortly), that concurrency may also use parallelism under the hood. Now, let’s dive into how async programming in Rust actually works. (confidence: 0.80)

In Rust, concurrency is both safe and manageable due to the language&#8217;s ownership system and threading model. This guide will delve into the use of threads and async/await in Rust, providing a comprehensive understanding with actionable examples. 1. Introduction Concurrency allows your program to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, enhancing responsiveness and resource utilization. Rust&#8217;s approach to concurrency focuses on memory safety without a garbage collector, making it unique. This guide will explore both low-level threads and high-level async/await programming, demonstrating their implementation and best practices. What You&#8217;ll Learn How to use threads for concurrent execution. Async/await for non-blocking operations. Effective communication between threads. Error handling and debugging techniques. Prerequisites Familiarity with Rust syntax and concepts (ownership, lifetimes). Basic understanding of concurrency and parallelism. Tools Needed Rust 1.65+ for async/await syntax. Cargo (build tool and package manager). Tokio runtime for async programming. Rustfmt and Clippy for code style and best practices. Resources The Rust Programming Language Book Tokio Documentation 2. Technical Background Concurrency is about executing tasks independently, improving system utilization. Rust leverages its ownership system to ensure data safety across threads without a garbage collector. Core Concepts Concurrency: Executing multiple tasks in overlapping time periods. Parallelism: Simultaneous execution of tasks on multiple CPUs. Threads: lightweight processes managed by the OS. Async/await: Non-blocking operations for efficient resource use. Under the Hood Rust&#8217;s threading model is 1:1, where each thread maps to an OS thread. The async/await syntax uses async tasks atop a runtime like Tokio, providing an ergonomic, non-blocking API. Best Practices and Pitfalls Avoid Shared State: Use channels for thread communication. Handle Panics: Use Result or std::panic for proper error handling. Join Threads: Wait for thread completion to avoid data races. 3. Implementation Guide This section provides a step-by-step guide to working with threads and async/await. Step 1: Basic Threads Here’s a basic thread example: fn main() { let handle = std::thread::spawn(|| { println!(&quot;Hello from a new thread!&quot;); }); handle.join().unwrap(); println!(&quot;Main thread done.&quot;); } Step 2: Thread Communication Use channels to send data between threads: use std::sync::mpsc; fn main() { let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel(); let handle = std::thread::spawn(move || { let message = &quot;Hello from thread!&quot;; tx.send(message).unwrap(); println!(&quot;Message sent: {}&quot;, message); }); let received = rx.recv().unwrap(); println!(&quot;Received in main: {}&quot;, received); handle.join().unwrap(); } Step 3: Async/Await Basics An example using Tokio: #[tokio::main] async fn main() { let task_handle = tokio::spawn(async { println!(&quot;Hello from async task!&quot;); }); println!(&quot;Main async task running.&quot;); task_handle.await.unwrap(); println!(&quot;Main async task done.&quot;); } 4. Code Examples Basic Thread Example use std::thread; use std::time::Duration; fn main() { thread::spawn(move || { for i in 1..5 { println!(&quot;Thread: number {}&quot;, i); thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500)); } }); for i in 1..5 { println!(&quot;Main: number {}&quot;, i); thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500)); } } Shared State with Mutex use std::sync::Mutex; use std::sync::Arc; use std::thread; fn main() { let counter = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0)); let mut handles = vec![]; for _ in 0..10 { let counter = Arc::clone(&amp;counter); let handle = thread::spawn(move || { let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap(); *num += 1; println!(&quot;Thread incremented counter to {}&quot;, *num); }); handles.push(handle); } for handle in handles { handle.join().unwrap(); } println!(&quot;Final counter value: {}&quot;, *Arc::try_unwrap(counter).unwrap().into_inner().unwrap()); } Async/Await Example use tokio::time::{sleep, Duration}; #[tokio::main] async fn main() { let task1 = tokio::spawn(async { sleep(Duration::from_millis(1000)).await; &quot;Task 1 completed&quot; }); let task2 = tokio::spawn(async { sleep(Duration::from_millis(2000)).await; &quot;Task 2 completed&quot; }); println!(&quot;First task result: {}&quot;, task1.await.unwrap()); println!(&quot;Second task result: {}&quot;, task2.await.unwrap()); } Handling Errors with Join #[tokio::main] async fn main() { let task = tokio::spawn(async { tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(100)).await; panic!(&quot;Something went wrong in the task!&quot;); }); if let Err(e) = task.await { eprintln!(&quot;Task failed with error: {:?}&quot;, e); } } 5. Best Practices and Optimization Performance Considerations Minimize cloning into threads: use std::thread; fn main() { let data = String::from(&quot;large data&quot;); // Clone data only once let data_clone = data.clone(); let handle = thread::spawn(move || { println!(&quot;Thread received: {}&quot;, data_clone); }); // No need to move original data handle.join().unwrap(); } Security Considerations Avoid race conditions by using atomic operations: use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering}; use std::sync::Arc; use std::thread; fn main() { let counter = Arc::new(AtomicUsize::new(0)); let mut handles = vec![]; for _ in 0..10 { let counter = Arc::clone(&amp;counter); let handle = thread::spawn(move || { let mut num = counter.fetch_add(1, Ordering::SeqCst) + 1; println!(&quot;Thread incremented counter to {}&quot;, num); }); handles.push(handle); } for handle in handles { handle.join().unwrap(); } println!(&quot;Final counter value: {}&quot;, counter.load(Ordering::SeqCst)); } Code Organization Organize your project logically: src/ main.rs lib/ mods.rs async_task.rs thread_task.rs tests/ integration.rs Common Mistakes Avoid shared mutable state without synchronization: // Bad practice use std::sync::Arc; use std::thread; struct SharedData { counter: usize, } unsafe impl Sync for SharedData {} fn main() { let data = Arc::new(SharedData { counter: 0 }); let mut handles = vec![]; for _ in 0..10 { let data = Arc::clone(&amp;data); let handle = thread::spawn(move || { data.counter += 1; println!(&quot;Thread incremented counter to {}&quot;, data.counter); }); handles.push(handle); } for handle in handles { handle.join().unwrap(); } // Undefined behavior due to data race! } Correcting it with Mutex: use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex}; use std::thread; fn main() { let counter = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0)); let mut handles = vec![]; for _ in 0..10 { let counter = Arc::clone(&amp;counter); let handle = thread::spawn(move || { let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap(); *num += 1; println!(&quot;Thread incremented counter to {}&quot;, *num); }); handles.push(handle); } for handle in handles { handle.join().unwrap(); } } 6. Testing and Debugging Testing Concurrent Code #[cfg(test)] mod tests { use super::*; use std::time::Duration; use std::thread; #[test] fn testConcurrency() { let (tx, rx) = std::sync::mpsc::channel(); thread::spawn(move || { thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500)); tx.send(42).unwrap(); }); assert_eq!(rx.recv_timeout(Duration::from_millis(1000)).unwrap(), 42); } #[test] #[ignore] fn testFasterThanMain() { // This test is flaky and may fail, so it&#x27;s ignored by default let (tx, rx) = std::sync::mpsc::channel(); thread::spawn(|| { tx.send(42).unwrap(); }); assert_eq!(rx.recv().unwrap(), 42); } } Debugging Tips Use println! for simple debugging: #[tokio::main] async fn main() { println!(&quot;Starting async task&quot;); let task = tokio::spawn(async { tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(1000)).await; println!(&quot;Task completed&quot;); }); task.await.unwrap(); } Common Issues and Solutions Handling panics in threads: use std::thread; fn main() { let handle = thread::spawn(move || { panic!(&quot;Something went wrong in the thread!&quot;); }); if let Err(e) = handle.join() { eprintln!(&quot;Thread panicked with error: {:?}&quot;, e); } } Within async tasks: #[tokio::main] async fn main() { let task = tokio::spawn(async { panic!(&quot;Something went wrong in the async task!&quot;); }); if let Err(e) = task.await { eprintln!(&quot;Async task failed with error: {:?}&quot;, e); } } Fixing deadlocks by avoiding waiting in async contexts: #[tokio::main(flavor = &quot;current_thread&quot;)] async fn main() { let task = tokio::spawn(async { // Perform async operation here }); task.await.unwrap(); } Avoiding Race Conditions: Use appropriate synchronization primitives like Mutex or RwLock. use std::sync::{Arc, RwLock}; use std::thread; fn main() { let data = Arc::new(RwLock::new(0)); let mut handles = vec![]; for _ in 0..10 { let data = Arc::clone(&amp;data); let handle = thread::spawn(move || { let mut num = data.write().unwrap(); *num += 1; println!(&quot;Thread incremented counter to {}&quot;, *num); }); handles.push(handle); } for handle in handles { handle.join().unwrap(); } } 7.

Leapcell 4 min read · Apr 17, 2025 -- 1 Listen Share Asynchronous programming comes with certain complexities, and it’s easy to make mistakes when using async in Rust. This article discusses common pitfalls in Rust asynchronous runtimes. Unexpected Synchronous Blocking Accidentally performing synchronous blocking operations in asynchronous code is a major pitfall. It undermines the advantages of async programming and causes performance bottlenecks. Here are some common scenarios: Using blocking I/O operations in an async function: For example, directly calling standard blocking functions like std::fs::File::open or std::net::TcpStream::connect inside an async fn . Performing CPU-intensive tasks inside async closures: Running heavy computations in an async closure can block the current thread and affect the execution of other async tasks. Using blocking libraries or functions in async code: Some libraries may not offer async interfaces and can only be called synchronously. Using these in async code can cause blocking. Take a look at the following code to compare the difference between using std::thread::sleep and tokio::time::sleep : use tokio::task; use tokio::time::Duration; async fn handle_request() { println!(&quot;Start processing request&quot;); // tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)).await; // Correct: use tokio::time::sleep std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)); // Incorrect: using std::thread::sleep println!(&quot;Request processing completed&quot;); } #[tokio::main(flavor = &quot;current_thread&quot;)] // Use tokio::main macro in single-thread mode async fn main() { let start = std::time::Instant::now(); // Launch multiple concurrent tasks let handles = (0..10).map(|_| { task::spawn(handle_request()) }).collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;(); // Optionally wait for all tasks to complete for handle in handles { handle.await.unwrap(); } println!(&quot;All requests completed, elapsed time: {:?}&quot;, start.elapsed()); } How to Avoid the Trap of Synchronous Blocking? Use asynchronous libraries and functions: Prefer libraries that offer async interfaces, such as async I/O, timers, and networking provided by runtimes like tokio or async-std . Offload CPU-intensive tasks to a dedicated thread pool: If heavy computation is needed in async code, use tokio::task::spawn_blocking or async-std::task::spawn_blocking to move those tasks to a separate thread pool, avoiding main thread blocking. Carefully review dependencies: When using third-party libraries, verify if they provide async interfaces to avoid introducing blocking operations. Use tools for analysis: Performance analysis tools can help detect blocking operations in async code. For example, tokio offers a tool called console . Forgetting .await An asynchronous function returns a Future , and you must use .await to actually execute it and retrieve the result. Forgetting to use .await will result in the Future not being executed at all. Consider the following code: async fn my_async_function() -&gt; i32 { 42 } #[tokio::main] async fn main() { // Incorrect: forgot `.await`, the function will not execute my_async_function(); // Correct let result = my_async_function().await; println!(&quot;The result of the correct async operation is: {}&quot;, result); } Overusing spawn Excessively spawning lightweight tasks introduces overhead from task scheduling and context switching, which can actually reduce performance. In the example below, we multiply each number by 2, store the result in a Vec , and finally print the number of elements in the Vec . Both incorrect and correct approaches are demonstrated: use async_std::task; async fn process_item(item: i32) -&gt; i32 { // A very simple operation item * 2 } async fn bad_use_of_spawn() { let mut results = Vec::new(); for i in 0..10000 { // Incorrect: spawning a task for each simple operation let handle = task::spawn(process_item(i)); results.push(handle.await); } println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, results.len()); } async fn good_use_of_spawn() { let mut results = Vec::new(); for i in 0..10000 { results.push(process_item(i).await); } println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, results.len()); } fn main() { task::block_on(async { bad_use_of_spawn().await; good_use_of_spawn().await; }); } In the incorrect example above, a new task is spawned for each simple multiplication, leading to massive overhead from task scheduling. The correct approach directly awaits the async function, avoiding extra overhead. We should only use spawn when true concurrency is required. For CPU-intensive or long-running I/O-bound tasks, spawn is appropriate. For very lightweight tasks, directly using .await is typically more efficient. You can also manage multiple tasks more effectively using tokio::task::JoinSet . Conclusion Async Rust is powerful, but easy to misuse. Avoid blocking calls, don’t forget .await , and only spawn when needed. Write with care, and your async code will stay fast and reliable. We are Leapcell, your top choice for hosting Rust projects.

One core can be performing one task while another core performs a completely unrelated one, and those operations actually happen at the same time. When working with async in Rust, we’re always dealing with concurrency. Depending on the hardware, the operating system, and the async runtime we are using (more on async runtimes shortly), that concurrency may also use parallelism under the hood. Now, let’s dive into how async programming in Rust actually works.

Finding from Mastering Concurrency in Rust: Complete Tutorial for Threads and Async ...: Mastering Concurrency in Rust: Complete Tutorial for Threads and Async/Await Skip to content Codez Up Code the Way Up Menu Home Javascript Java React Node.js Python Angular About Us Contact US Mastering Concurrency in Rust: A Hands-On Guide to Threads and Async/Await By codezup | June 12, 2025 0 Comment Concurrency is a fundamental aspect of modern software development, enabling applications to perform multiple tasks efficiently. In Rust, concurrency is both safe and manageable due to the language&#8217;s ownership system and threading model. This guide will delve into the use of threads and async/await in Rust, providing a comprehensive understanding with actionable examples. 1. Introduction Concurrency allows your program to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, enhancing responsiveness and resource utilization. Rust&#8217;s approach to concurrency focuses on memory safety without a garbage collector, making it unique. This guide will explore both low-level threads and high-level async/await programming, demonstrating their implementation and best practices. What You&#8217;ll Learn How to use threads for concurrent execution. Async/await for non-blocking operations. Effective communication between threads. Error handling and debugging techniques. Prerequisites Familiarity with Rust syntax and concepts (ownership, lifetimes). Basic understanding of concurrency and parallelism. Tools Needed Rust 1.65+ for async/await syntax. Cargo (build tool and package manager). Tokio runtime for async programming. Rustfmt and Clippy for code style and best practices. Resources The Rust Programming Language Book Tokio Documentation 2. Technical Background Concurrency is about executing tasks independently, improving system utilization. Rust leverages its ownership system to ensure data safety across threads without a garbage collector. Core Concepts Concurrency: Executing multiple tasks in overlapping time periods. Parallelism: Simultaneous execution of tasks on multiple CPUs. Threads: lightweight processes managed by the OS. Async/await: Non-blocking operations for efficient resource use. Under the Hood Rust&#8217;s threading model is 1:1, where each thread maps to an OS thread. The async/await syntax uses async tasks atop a runtime like Tokio, providing an ergonomic, non-blocking API. Best Practices and Pitfalls Avoid Shared State: Use channels for thread communication. Handle Panics: Use Result or std::panic for proper error handling. Join Threads: Wait for thread completion to avoid data races. 3. Implementation Guide This section provides a step-by-step guide to working with threads and async/await. Step 1: Basic Threads Here’s a basic thread example: fn main() { let handle = std::thread::spawn(|| { println!(&quot;Hello from a new thread!&quot;); }); handle.join().unwrap(); println!(&quot;Main thread done.&quot;); } Step 2: Thread Communication Use channels to send data between threads: use std::sync::mpsc; fn main() { let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel(); let handle = std::thread::spawn(move || { let message = &quot;Hello from thread!&quot;; tx.send(message).unwrap(); println!(&quot;Message sent: {}&quot;, message); }); let received = rx.recv().unwrap(); println!(&quot;Received in main: {}&quot;, received); handle.join().unwrap(); } Step 3: Async/Await Basics An example using Tokio: #[tokio::main] async fn main() { let task_handle = tokio::spawn(async { println!(&quot;Hello from async task!&quot;); }); println!(&quot;Main async task running.&quot;); task_handle.await.unwrap(); println!(&quot;Main async task done.&quot;); } 4. Code Examples Basic Thread Example use std::thread; use std::time::Duration; fn main() { thread::spawn(move || { for i in 1..5 { println!(&quot;Thread: number {}&quot;, i); thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500)); } }); for i in 1..5 { println!(&quot;Main: number {}&quot;, i); thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500)); } } Shared State with Mutex use std::sync::Mutex; use std::sync::Arc; use std::thread; fn main() { let counter = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0)); let mut handles = vec![]; for _ in 0..10 { let counter = Arc::clone(&amp;counter); let handle = thread::spawn(move || { let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap(); *num += 1; println!(&quot;Thread incremented counter to {}&quot;, *num); }); handles.push(handle); } for handle in handles { handle.join().unwrap(); } println!(&quot;Final counter value: {}&quot;, *Arc::try_unwrap(counter).unwrap().into_inner().unwrap()); } Async/Await Example use tokio::time::{sleep, Duration}; #[tokio::main] async fn main() { let task1 = tokio::spawn(async { sleep(Duration::from_millis(1000)).await; &quot;Task 1 completed&quot; }); let task2 = tokio::spawn(async { sleep(Duration::from_millis(2000)).await; &quot;Task 2 completed&quot; }); println!(&quot;First task result: {}&quot;, task1.await.unwrap()); println!(&quot;Second task result: {}&quot;, task2.await.unwrap()); } Handling Errors with Join #[tokio::main] async fn main() { let task = tokio::spawn(async { tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(100)).await; panic!(&quot;Something went wrong in the task!&quot;); }); if let Err(e) = task.await { eprintln!(&quot;Task failed with error: {:?}&quot;, e); } } 5. Best Practices and Optimization Performance Considerations Minimize cloning into threads: use std::thread; fn main() { let data = String::from(&quot;large data&quot;); // Clone data only once let data_clone = data.clone(); let handle = thread::spawn(move || { println!(&quot;Thread received: {}&quot;, data_clone); }); // No need to move original data handle.join().unwrap(); } Security Considerations Avoid race conditions by using atomic operations: use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering}; use std::sync::Arc; use std::thread; fn main() { let counter = Arc::new(AtomicUsize::new(0)); let mut handles = vec![]; for _ in 0..10 { let counter = Arc::clone(&amp;counter); let handle = thread::spawn(move || { let mut num = counter.fetch_add(1, Ordering::SeqCst) + 1; println!(&quot;Thread incremented counter to {}&quot;, num); }); handles.push(handle); } for handle in handles { handle.join().unwrap(); } println!(&quot;Final counter value: {}&quot;, counter.load(Ordering::SeqCst)); } Code Organization Organize your project logically: src/ main.rs lib/ mods.rs async_task.rs thread_task.rs tests/ integration.rs Common Mistakes Avoid shared mutable state without synchronization: // Bad practice use std::sync::Arc; use std::thread; struct SharedData { counter: usize, } unsafe impl Sync for SharedData {} fn main() { let data = Arc::new(SharedData { counter: 0 }); let mut handles = vec![]; for _ in 0..10 { let data = Arc::clone(&amp;data); let handle = thread::spawn(move || { data.counter += 1; println!(&quot;Thread incremented counter to {}&quot;, data.counter); }); handles.push(handle); } for handle in handles { handle.join().unwrap(); } // Undefined behavior due to data race! } Correcting it with Mutex: use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex}; use std::thread; fn main() { let counter = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0)); let mut handles = vec![]; for _ in 0..10 { let counter = Arc::clone(&amp;counter); let handle = thread::spawn(move || { let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap(); *num += 1; println!(&quot;Thread incremented counter to {}&quot;, *num); }); handles.push(handle); } for handle in handles { handle.join().unwrap(); } } 6. Testing and Debugging Testing Concurrent Code #[cfg(test)] mod tests { use super::*; use std::time::Duration; use std::thread; #[test] fn testConcurrency() { let (tx, rx) = std::sync::mpsc::channel(); thread::spawn(move || { thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500)); tx.send(42).unwrap(); }); assert_eq!(rx.recv_timeout(Duration::from_millis(1000)).unwrap(), 42); } #[test] #[ignore] fn testFasterThanMain() { // This test is flaky and may fail, so it&#x27;s ignored by default let (tx, rx) = std::sync::mpsc::channel(); thread::spawn(|| { tx.send(42).unwrap(); }); assert_eq!(rx.recv().unwrap(), 42); } } Debugging Tips Use println! for simple debugging: #[tokio::main] async fn main() { println!(&quot;Starting async task&quot;); let task = tokio::spawn(async { tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(1000)).await; println!(&quot;Task completed&quot;); }); task.await.unwrap(); } Common Issues and Solutions Handling panics in threads: use std::thread; fn main() { let handle = thread::spawn(move || { panic!(&quot;Something went wrong in the thread!&quot;); }); if let Err(e) = handle.join() { eprintln!(&quot;Thread panicked with error: {:?}&quot;, e); } } Within async tasks: #[tokio::main] async fn main() { let task = tokio::spawn(async { panic!(&quot;Something went wrong in the async task!&quot;); }); if let Err(e) = task.await { eprintln!(&quot;Async task failed with error: {:?}&quot;, e); } } Fixing deadlocks by avoiding waiting in async contexts: #[tokio::main(flavor = &quot;current_thread&quot;)] async fn main() { let task = tokio::spawn(async { // Perform async operation here }); task.await.unwrap(); } Avoiding Race Conditions: Use appropriate synchronization primitives like Mutex or RwLock. use std::sync::{Arc, RwLock}; use std::thread; fn main() { let data = Arc::new(RwLock::new(0)); let mut handles = vec![]; for _ in 0..10 { let data = Arc::clone(&amp;data); let handle = thread::spawn(move || { let mut num = data.write().unwrap(); *num += 1; println!(&quot;Thread incremented counter to {}&quot;, *num); }); handles.push(handle); } for handle in handles { handle.join().unwrap(); } } 7.

Leapcell 4 min read · Apr 17, 2025 -- 1 Listen Share Asynchronous programming comes with certain complexities, and it’s easy to make mistakes when using async in Rust. This article discusses common pitfalls in Rust asynchronous runtimes. Unexpected Synchronous Blocking Accidentally performing synchronous blocking operations in asynchronous code is a major pitfall. It undermines the advantages of async programming and causes performance bottlenecks. Here are some common scenarios: Using blocking I/O operations in an async function: For example, directly calling standard blocking functions like std::fs::File::open or std::net::TcpStream::connect inside an async fn . Performing CPU-intensive tasks inside async closures: Running heavy computations in an async closure can block the current thread and affect the execution of other async tasks. Using blocking libraries or functions in async code: Some libraries may not offer async interfaces and can only be called synchronously. Using these in async code can cause blocking. Take a look at the following code to compare the difference between using std::thread::sleep and tokio::time::sleep : use tokio::task; use tokio::time::Duration; async fn handle_request() { println!(&quot;Start processing request&quot;); // tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)).await; // Correct: use tokio::time::sleep std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)); // Incorrect: using std::thread::sleep println!(&quot;Request processing completed&quot;); } #[tokio::main(flavor = &quot;current_thread&quot;)] // Use tokio::main macro in single-thread mode async fn main() { let start = std::time::Instant::now(); // Launch multiple concurrent tasks let handles = (0..10).map(|_| { task::spawn(handle_request()) }).collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;(); // Optionally wait for all tasks to complete for handle in handles { handle.await.unwrap(); } println!(&quot;All requests completed, elapsed time: {:?}&quot;, start.elapsed()); } How to Avoid the Trap of Synchronous Blocking? Use asynchronous libraries and functions: Prefer libraries that offer async interfaces, such as async I/O, timers, and networking provided by runtimes like tokio or async-std . Offload CPU-intensive tasks to a dedicated thread pool: If heavy computation is needed in async code, use tokio::task::spawn_blocking or async-std::task::spawn_blocking to move those tasks to a separate thread pool, avoiding main thread blocking. Carefully review dependencies: When using third-party libraries, verify if they provide async interfaces to avoid introducing blocking operations. Use tools for analysis: Performance analysis tools can help detect blocking operations in async code. For example, tokio offers a tool called console . Forgetting .await An asynchronous function returns a Future , and you must use .await to actually execute it and retrieve the result. Forgetting to use .await will result in the Future not being executed at all. Consider the following code: async fn my_async_function() -&gt; i32 { 42 } #[tokio::main] async fn main() { // Incorrect: forgot `.await`, the function will not execute my_async_function(); // Correct let result = my_async_function().await; println!(&quot;The result of the correct async operation is: {}&quot;, result); } Overusing spawn Excessively spawning lightweight tasks introduces overhead from task scheduling and context switching, which can actually reduce performance. In the example below, we multiply each number by 2, store the result in a Vec , and finally print the number of elements in the Vec . Both incorrect and correct approaches are demonstrated: use async_std::task; async fn process_item(item: i32) -&gt; i32 { // A very simple operation item * 2 } async fn bad_use_of_spawn() { let mut results = Vec::new(); for i in 0..10000 { // Incorrect: spawning a task for each simple operation let handle = task::spawn(process_item(i)); results.push(handle.await); } println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, results.len()); } async fn good_use_of_spawn() { let mut results = Vec::new(); for i in 0..10000 { results.push(process_item(i).await); } println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, results.len()); } fn main() { task::block_on(async { bad_use_of_spawn().await; good_use_of_spawn().await; }); } In the incorrect example above, a new task is spawned for each simple multiplication, leading to massive overhead from task scheduling. The correct approach directly awaits the async function, avoiding extra overhead. We should only use spawn when true concurrency is required. For CPU-intensive or long-running I/O-bound tasks, spawn is appropriate. For very lightweight tasks, directly using .await is typically more efficient. You can also manage multiple tasks more effectively using tokio::task::JoinSet . Conclusion Async Rust is powerful, but easy to misuse. Avoid blocking calls, don’t forget .await , and only spawn when needed. Write with care, and your async code will stay fast and reliable. We are Leapcell, your top choice for hosting Rust projects.
